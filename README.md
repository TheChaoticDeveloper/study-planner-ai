Side note(s): Overuse of the AI will result in the developer (me) to pay 5$ as OpenAI only allows you to use their API keys if I have a credit balance of 5$ or more placed my OpenAI account.

1,000 or more requests/responses by the AI could result in the developer (me) having to pay 5$ (or more) so it would be appreciated if anyone using my project to send a limited amount of messages to the AI.

Thanks and enjoy my AI
